# Malaria-Cell-Classification-VGG19
A project where I classified cell images into two categories: infected with malaria and uninfected. I utilized a dataset comprised of malaria cell images, leverage the VGG19 convolutional neural network model,  data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques to improve accuracy
